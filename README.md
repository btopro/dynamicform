# dynamicform
a client-side dynamic form generator

This library enables adding forms with a custom HTML tag '<dynamicform>'. This tag needs an 'id' attribute and 'data-json' attribute includes path of related form JSON file. There is an example HTML file in repo.
There is an example usage below:
```
<dynamicform id="form1" data-json="../forms/form1.json"></dynamicform>
```

This JSON file includes the structure of the related form. There is an example JSON file in repo.

There are two versions of this library:
1) JQuery version 
2) Pure JavaScript version (in development for now)

Any contribution, suggestion or comment is more than welcome.
